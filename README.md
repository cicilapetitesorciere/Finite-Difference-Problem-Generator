Randomly generates a finite difference problem and solution.

# Installation and Use
Clone the repo and open `fd.html` in your favourite browser (sorry I'm not currently hosting it anywhere online). Click "Generate New" to generate a new finite difference table. For instance

Take some time to solve it (i.e. find the lowest order polynomial which passes through all the points in the table), then click "Check" to see the solution. For instance:
